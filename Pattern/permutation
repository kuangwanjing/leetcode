1053. Previous Permutation With One Swap:
    get the previous permutation of a sequence. Look into the trend of the sequence:

    For example, in the sequence of "3 4 1 2 3", "1 2 3" is the smallest in the permutations so there is no possible swap that can made to get a smaller sequence. We denotes the point that breaks the non-descreasing trend from right to left "LEFT" and The subsequence [LEFT:RIGHTMOST] is non-descreasing. So one of the swapped element must be "[LEFT-1]" since we want the largest smaller sequence, keeping the sub sequence left to the "LEFT-1" can guarantees the swapped sequence is the largest one.

    Then find the other swapped element. Since the rightmost sequence is non-descreasing, find the one that is smaller than "LEFT-1" and the largest among the sub sequence. If there are more than one such elements, find the one that is nearest to "LEFT-1". For example, the swap of sequence "3 1 1 3" should be the first 3 and the first 1.

    This problem is a typical greedy problem taking consideration into the trend of the sequence.
